# Task Continuity Protocol

Use this when a task may span multiple sessions.

## Task state file

For non-trivial work, create or update:

    .agent/tasks/<task-id>/state.md

If `.agent/` is not desired in the repo, use:

    /tmp/<task-id>-state.md

## state.md structure

    # Task State

    ## Objective
    What we are trying to achieve.

    ## Current phase
    brainstorm / write-plan / execute / review / follow-up

    ## Decisions made
    Short list of accepted design decisions.

    ## Current assumptions
    What is assumed and should be verified.

    ## Files touched
    List of changed files.

    ## Tests / validation
    What was run and results.

    ## Open questions
    What is unresolved.

    ## Next action
    The next concrete step.

    ## Artifacts
    Paths to plans, review reports, notes.

    ## Last known good point
    Branch, commit, or state before risky changes.

## Rules

Keep this file short.
Use it as a pointer, not a full transcript.
Update it at the end of each substantial session.

Claude Code's context is summarized automatically when a conversation grows long,
but a `state.md` lets a **fresh** session resume without re-deriving everything.
